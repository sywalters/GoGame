## Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Backend Requirement

This frontend requires the Python FastAPI backend to be running on `http://localhost:8008`.

## Key Differences from React Version

- **State Management**: Uses Angular's built-in reactive forms and component state instead of React hooks
- **HTTP Client**: Uses Angular's HttpClient service with RxJS observables instead of fetch API
- **Styling**: Same CSS styles but organized in component-specific files
- **Template Syntax**: Uses Angular template syntax with directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and event binding with `()`
- **Component Architecture**: Uses Angular components with decorators and dependency injection

## Components

### GameBoardComponent
